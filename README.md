# database-exploration

A state server implemented using Redis and MongoDB, to highlight the differences in Key/Value and Document based databases.  

Can insert/remove keys from the database(s). It also keeps track of versions if there are multiple inserts with the same key. 

Best way to use/test the database is using Restman (Chrome Extension). Postman also works, but unneccessary for a project of this size.
